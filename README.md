# Maze solver robot swarm (in webots)
IIT Guwahati, Robotics Lab
Problem Description: 
1 SUMMARY
Create a Webots simulation demonstrating Maze solver robot swarm, with the following specifications:
â€¢ A maze having single entry and single exit shall be present. A group of robots have to solve the maze as soon as possible, by finding the exit. The robots can share data with each other to build on and use the collective knowledge acquired by the swarm. Pheromoning or any other suitable methodology can be used for communication among the robots of the swarm.
2 INTRODUCTION
There are two different types of maze solving algorithms. The first type of algorithms assumes that the robot who is going to explore a maze, has no prior knowledge about the maze.On the other hand the second type of algorithms is designed to be used by a computer or a person, who knows maze structure and can analyze it off-line.
Unfortunately, the real life conditions are not as comfortable as assumptions of the second type of algorithms. In the majority of cases, a traveller does not have any perspective on the whole area, which should be explored. As a consequence, algorithms useful in real life scenarios, fall into the first of the aforementioned categories.
